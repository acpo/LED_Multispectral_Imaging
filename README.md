# LED_Multispectral_Imaging
multispectral imaging with LEDs and python

A reworking of the project described by Pineda et al. in [Hardware X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246806722200027X).  Pineda, D., PÃ©rez, J.C., Gaviria, D., Ospino-Villalba, K.S. and Camargo, O., 2022. MEDUSA: An open-source and webcam based multispectral imaging system. HardwareX, p.e00282.  

The idea is fantastic, all credit to the authors.  But I think that I can pursue even lower cost.  Right now, this repository is made so that I don't lose the information.  
The original authors' files are in an OSF archive [MEDUSA: An ultra-low-cost webcam based multispectral imaging system](https://osf.io/zhp4m/files/).
