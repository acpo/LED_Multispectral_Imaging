# LED_Multispectral_Imaging
multispectral imaging with LEDs and python

A reworking of the project described by Pineda et al. in [Hardware X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246806722200027X).  The idea is fantastic, all credit to the authors.  But I think that I can pursue even lower cost.  Right now, this repository is made so that I don't lose the information.
